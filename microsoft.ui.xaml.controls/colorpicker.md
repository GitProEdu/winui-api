# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ColorPicker

## -description

Represents a control that lets a user pick a color using a color spectrum, sliders, or text input.

## -remarks

A color picker is used to browse through and select colors. By default, it lets a user navigate through colors on a color spectrum, or specify a Red-Green-Blue (RGB), Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV), or hexadecimal color value in a text box.

For more info about the ColorPicker control, see [Color picker](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/color-picker).
