# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.InfoBar

<!--
public class InfoBar : Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Control
-->


## -description

An `InfoBar` is an inline notification for essential app-wide messages. The `InfoBar` will take up space in a layout and will not cover up other content or float on top of it. It supports rich content (including titles, messages, icons, and buttons) and can be configured to be user-dismissable or persistent.

## -remarks

Use an `InfoBar` control when a user should be informed of, acknowledge, or take action on a changed application state. The changed state should impact app perception or experience for the user.

## -examples

See the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app for examples of WinUI features and controls.

If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed, see the [InfoBar](xamlcontrolsgallery:/item/InfoBar) in action.

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
