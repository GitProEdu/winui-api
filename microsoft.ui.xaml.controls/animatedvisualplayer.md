# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.AnimatedVisualPlayer

## -description

An element that displays and controls an [IAnimatedVisual](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.ianimatedvisual).

## -remarks

The AnimatedVisualPlayer hosts and controls playback of an animated [Visual](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Composition.Visual) tree, integrating custom motion graphic content with XAML UI. For instance, the AnimatedVisualPlayer is used to display and control [Lottie](https://aka.ms/lottiedocs) animations.

## -examples

See the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app for examples of WinUI features and controls.

If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed, [open the app to see the AnimatedVisualPlayer in action](xamlcontrolsgallery:/item/AnimatedVisualPlayer).

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
