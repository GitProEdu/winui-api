If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed, see the [TabView](xamlcontrolsgallery:/item/TabView) in action.

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
