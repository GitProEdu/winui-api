<!--
public sealed class OverlappedPresenter : Microsoft.UI.Windowing.AppWindowPresenter
-->

## -description

Displays an app window using an overlapped configuration.

## -remarks

The OverlappedPresenter configures a window that can overlap and be overlapped by other windows. It can be resized, repositioned, maximized, minimized, and restored. System elements, like title bars, status bars, or the taskbar, are shown by default.

The default window uses an OverlappedPresenter in the Restored state.
