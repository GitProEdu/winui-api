To support [Holding](gesturerecognizer_holding.md) with touch and pen/stylus input, specify [Hold](gesturesettings.md) in the [GestureSettings](gesturerecognizer_gesturesettings.md) property.

To support [Holding](gesturerecognizer_holding.md) with mouse input, specify [HoldWithMouse](gesturesettings.md) in the [GestureSettings](gesturerecognizer_gesturesettings.md) property.

> [!NOTE]
> This class is not agile, which means that you need to consider its threading model and marshaling behavior.
