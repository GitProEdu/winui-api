# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation

## -description
Animates the value of a [Double](/dotnet/api/system.double?redirectedfrom=MSDN) property between two target values using linear interpolation over a specified [Duration](timeline_duration.md).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<DoubleAnimation />
```


## -remarks
Use DoubleAnimation to animate the property value of any dependency property that is of type [Double](/dotnet/api/system.double?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

Sometimes you'll need to use indirect property targeting in order to target a sub-property of another object that's the value of a property on the target. For example, in order to animate the X component of a [RenderTransform](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_rendertransform.md) of a [UIElement](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement.md), you need to reference some of the intermediate object-property values, until the last step in the indirect property path is truly a [Double](/dotnet/api/system.double?redirectedfrom=MSDN) value, as is the case with [TranslateTransform.X](../microsoft.ui.xaml.media/translatetransform_x.md). The correct string to use for [Storyboard.TargetProperty](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.media.animation.storyboard#xaml-attached-properties) in this example is "(UIElement.RenderTransform).(TranslateTransform.X)". For more info on indirect property targeting and other storyboarded animation concepts, see [Storyboarded animations](/windows/uwp/graphics/storyboarded-animations).

A DoubleAnimation typically has at least one of the [From](doubleanimation_from.md), [By](doubleanimation_by.md) or [To](doubleanimation_to.md) properties set, but never all three.
+ **From only:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the **From** property to the base value of the property being animated.
+ **From and To:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the **From** property to the value specified by the **To** property.
+ **From and By:** The animation progresses from the value specified by the **From** property to the value specified by the sum of the **From** and **By** properties.
+ **To only:** The animation progresses from the animated property's base value or a previous animation's output value to the value specified by the **To** property.
+ **By only:** The animation progresses from the base value of the property being animated or a previous animation's output value to the sum of that value and the value specified by the **By** property.


You can't animate the **X** and **Y** values of a [Point](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.point) using a DoubleAnimation, because these properties aren't dependency properties ([Point](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.point) is a structure and can't have dependency properties.) Instead, use [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md) to animate dependency properties that have a [Point](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.point) value.

You also can't use DoubleAnimation to animate **int** values or **byte** values. Instead, you'll have to use [ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames](objectanimationusingkeyframes.md), which won't give you an interpolation behavior, so you might need to define multiple keyframes to get a reasonably smooth animation. There aren't many UI-related dependency properties that use **int** values or **byte** values, so this shouldn't be a common scenario other than for custom properties.

The [From](doubleanimation_from.md), [By](doubleanimation_by.md) or [To](doubleanimation_to.md) properties of a DoubleAnimation aren't strictly a [Double](/dotnet/api/system.double?redirectedfrom=MSDN). Instead these are a [Nullable](/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1) for [Double](/dotnet/api/system.double?redirectedfrom=MSDN). The default value for these is **null**, not 0. That **null** value is how the animation system distinguishes that you haven't specifically set a value. VisualÂ C++ component extensions (C++/CX) doesn't have a [Nullable](/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1) type, so it uses [IReference](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.ireference`1) instead.

## -examples
The following example shows how to use **DoubleAnimation** to create a rectangle that fades in and out of view after it is loaded.
