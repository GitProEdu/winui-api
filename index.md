# Windows UI Library namespaces

## -description

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications.

There are two versions of WinUI that ship as NuGet packages: **WinUI 2.x** and **WinUI 3**. See the [Windows UI Library overview](/windows/apps/winui/) for more details on both.

The namespaces and APIs documented here are valid for both versions.

- **WinUI 2.x**

  The WinUI 2.x NuGet package is installed through the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager and can be used in standard UWP projects, or in Win32 apps via XAML Islands.

  For more details, see [Getting started with the Windows UI 2.x Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/winui2/getting-started).

- **WinUI 3**

  WinUI 3 Previews can be used in all Desktop apps. Download and install the [WinUI 3 Preview VSIX package](https://aka.ms/winui3/previewdownload). This adds both the WinUI 3 project templates and the NuGet package containing the WinUI 3 libraries to Visual Studio 2019.

  For instructions and more details, see [Windows UI Library 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview (March 2021)](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/).

### Samples

See examples of WinUI features and controls in the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app.

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
