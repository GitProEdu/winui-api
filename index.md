# Windows UI Library namespaces

## -description

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications.

There are two versions of WinUI that ship as NuGet packages: **WinUI 2** and **WinUI 3**. See the [Windows UI Library overview](/windows/apps/winui/) for more details on both.

The namespaces and APIs documented here are valid for both versions.

- **WinUI 2**

  The WinUI 2 NuGet package is installed through the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager and can be used in standard UWP projects, or in Win32 apps via XAML Islands.

  For more details, see [Getting started with the Windows UI 2 Library](/windows/apps/winui/winui2/getting-started).

- **WinUI 3**

  WinUI 3 can be used in all Desktop apps. Download and install the [Windows App SDK VSIX package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProjectReunion.MicrosoftProjectReunion). This adds both the WinUI 3 project templates and the NuGet package containing the WinUI 3 libraries to Visual Studio 2019.

  For instructions and more details, see [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/stable-channel).

### Samples

See examples of WinUI features and controls in the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app.

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3) for WinUI 3 controls and features).
