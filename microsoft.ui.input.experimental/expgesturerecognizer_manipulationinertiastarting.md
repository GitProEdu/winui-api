## -description

> [!CAUTION]
> This API is in development and considered experimental in the WinUI version selected. It might be altered or unavailable in other versions.

Occurs when all contact points are lifted during a manipulation and the velocity of the manipulation is significant enough to initiate inertia behavior (translation, expansion, or rotation continue after the input pointers are lifted).
