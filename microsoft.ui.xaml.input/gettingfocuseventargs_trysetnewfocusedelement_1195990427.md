# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Input.GettingFocusEventArgs.TrySetNewFocusedElement

## -description
Attempts to redirect focus to the specified element instead of the original targeted element.

## -parameters
### -param element
The object on which to set focus.

## -returns
True, if the focus action is redirected; otherwise, false.

## -remarks
The [GotFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_gotfocus.md) routed event is raised on an element after it receives focus, while the [LostFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_lostfocus.md) routed event is raised on an element after it loses focus. 

The [GettingFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_gettingfocus.md) and [LosingFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_losingfocus.md) routed events occur before the focus change takes place, which enables your application to modify or cancel the focus change behavior.   

[GettingFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_gettingfocus.md) and [LosingFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_losingfocus.md) are raised synchronously, while [GotFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_gotfocus.md) and [LostFocus](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_lostfocus.md) are raised asynchronously. For example, if your app calls the [Focus](../windows.ui.xaml.controls.control#Windows_UI_Xaml_Controls_Control_Focus_Windows_UI_Xaml_FocusState_) method of a control, GettingFocus is raised during the call, but GotFocus is raised after the call completes. 

If focus is moved while these events are still bubbling, an exception is thrown.
